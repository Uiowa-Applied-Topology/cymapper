Title: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs
Description: An implementation of various flavors of the mapper 
  algorithm (from the field of topological data analysis) in R, originally 
  developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and Carlsson (2007) 
  \doi{doi:10.2312/SPBG/SPBG07/091-100}, along with other tools for exploring 
  the output graph in more detail. This can be done either by exporting the raw 
  statistics, using the \pkg{igraph} package, or letting the package pass the 
  data to Cytoscape (sold separately for free 
  \href{https://cytoscape.org/}{here}) for further analysis.
