Title: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs
Description: An implementation of various flavors of the mapper 
  algorithm (from the field of topological data analysis) in R, originally 
  developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and Carlsson (2007) (link to paper [here](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf), along with other tools for exploring the output graph in more detail. This can be done either by exporting 
  the raw statistics, using the \pkg{igraph} package, or letting the package 
  pass the data to Cytoscape (sold separately for free 
  [here](https://cytoscape.org/)) for further analysis.
