Title: Use Cytoscape to Visualize Mapper Graphs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: George Clare Kennedy
Maintainer: George Clare Kennedy <george-clarekennedy@uiowa.edu>
Description: This is an implementation of the mapper and ballmapper algorithms, using Cytoscape for visualization.
    There is also a refined ballmapper, where we cluster within the balls and form our mapper graph as in conventional mapper (via intersecting clusters).
