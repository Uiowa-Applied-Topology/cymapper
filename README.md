This is an implementation of the [mapper](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf) algorithm by Singh, MÃ©moli, and Carlsson, and also the [ballmapper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07410.pdf) algorithm from Dlotko.

You will need to install the [RCy3](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html) package. To do this, start `R` (or RStudio), and enter the following commands:

`install.packages("BiocManager")`

`BiocManager::install("RCy3")`
