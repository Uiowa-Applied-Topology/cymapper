\title{mappeR: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs}
\description{
Topological data analysis (TDA) is a method of data analysis that uses techniques from topology to analyze high-dimensional data. 'mappeR' implements Mapper, an algorithm from this area developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and Carlsson (2007) (paper <[here]https://diglib.eg.org/items/d4e204e8-5dd2-4b5d-bccd-5da3c4a1e925>) which generalizes the concept of a <[Reeb graph]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph>. The output graph is able to be visualized in R using 'igraph' or using a free newtork analysis software called 'Cytoscape', available for download <[here.]https://cytoscape.org/>
