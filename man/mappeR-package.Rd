\title{mappeR: Construct and Visualize TDA Mapper Graphs}
\description{
An implementation of various flavors of the mapper algorithm (from the field of topological data analysis) in R, originally developed by Singh, MÃ©moli and Carlsson (2007) (link to paper [here](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf), along with other tools for exploring the output graph in more detail. This can be done either by exporting the raw statistics, using the \pkg{igraph} package, or letting the package pass the data to Cytoscape (sold separately for free [here](https://cytoscape.org/)) for further analysis.
